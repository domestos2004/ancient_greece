        <h1 class="padded-multiline" id="Aristotel">
            <span class="alfa">Aristotle is considered the most significant systematizer of philosophical and scientific
                knowledge accumulated before him.</span>
        </h1>

        <p>Developing his views on being, <em>Aristotle criticizes Plato's doctrine of the existence of ideas as
                absolutely
                independent pre-natural entities.</em> In his opinion, such ideas are only concepts that reflect the
            material
            world, that is, they are, as it were, copies of things, but not vice versa. Aristotle formulates his idea of
            ​​being perceived with the help of sensations. This objective, sensual world is the primary reality, nature,
            which is not defined by anyone. <br /><br />

            <strong>Matter is the universal cause, since without it there is no being, says Aristotle.</strong> The form
            plays the role
            of a sign. Thanks to it, matter is realized and a concrete object is formed. In other words, the form is
            presented as the sum of properties that distinguish one object from another, and is the essence of both the
            object and being as a whole. Form makes a thing what it really is. <br /><br />

            <strong>The soul of a person, like his essence or body form, gives meaning and direction to life.</strong>
            <em>“The soul is the
                cause and beginning of the living body…”</em> As the form dominates matter, so, respectively, the soul -
            over the
            body, the mind - over the senses. <mark>There are 3 types of soul:</mark> the plant soul, which plants
            possess; sensual,
            which animals are endowed with; reasonable, human. <br /><br />

            Aristotle's theory of knowledge is built from the position of empiricism, according to which the essence of
            things is known through sensations. And although sensations give us knowledge only of the individual, they
            potentially contain knowledge of the general, which is known by science. Philosophy is built on top of
            science, coinciding in many respects with logic. Logic helps to separate the general from the particular,
            truth from false knowledge. The method of identifying the general, with the help of which one can then
            explain single factors, Aristotle called induction. The method of proof from syllogisms, that is, from
            general conclusions, he called deduction. <br /><br />

            A significant place in the philosophy of Aristotle is occupied by man and the problems of social life.
            <strong>Man,
                in his opinion, is a <em>"political animal"</em>, which is characterized by an instinctive aspiration to
                <em>"joint
                    cohabitation"</em>.</strong> <em>“He who cannot enter and form part of a certain community, who does
                not need anyone or
                anything, is sufficient for himself, then, not being part of the state, he is either a beast or
                God.”</em> <br /><br />

            The purpose of the state is to ensure the happiness of all citizens, which include only those who own
            property and participate in the government of society. Slaves were not citizens. <br /><br />

            <mark>Aristotle singled out 6 forms of the state:</mark> 3 correct: aristocracy, monarchy and polity, and 3
            - incorrect:
            tyranny, oligarchy and democracy. The best form is polity, as it combines the characteristics of a moderate
            democracy and the personal dignity of an oligarchy, inherent in noble people.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h1 class="padded-multiline" id="Platon">
            <span class="alfa">Platon became the first Greek philosopher to create a holistic concept of objective
                idealism.</span>
        </h1>

        <p> <strong>Material existence is created by the Creator-demiurge in the same way as a person creates a specific
                thing.</strong>
            This Demiurge is the mind, which forms the material world out of chaos, formless movement, brings things
            <em>"out of disorder into order."</em><br /><br />

            Plato's theory of knowledge is based on the fact that <strong>a person has innate ideas,
                <em>"remembering"</em> which he
                discovers the world for himself.</strong><br /><br />

            <mark>Cognition itself is a process of contemplation by the mind of higher entities, and this process is
                divided
                into two stages:</mark> In the beginning, knowledge is carried out by a pure soul, because even before
            the birth of
            the body, it has already seen everything. However, when the soul enters the body of a person, then his
            bodily sense organs are connected to the process of cognition. Having settled in the body, the soul retains,
            but does not realize its knowledge. In the process of human development, she recalls her knowledge that she
            saw before. At the same time, sensory-empirical experience is only an impetus to recollection, therefore
            Plato advises turning to the soul, bypassing the senses if possible. This can be done with the help of
            speech, and the main means of recollection is the method of dialectics - conversation.<br /><br />

            <strong> Man is a unity of soul and body, which is based on the soul, for it is immortal.</strong> Since the
            soul exists
            before incarnation into the body, its existence does not depend on the body, and the destruction of the body
            is not the destruction of the soul. Simple entities are not destroyed; the soul, on the other hand, is a
            simple essence, therefore it cannot be broken up into its component parts, but only in this way does
            destruction occur. The soul is the embodiment of the idea of ​​life, therefore it cannot be subjected to
            death.<br /><br />

            <mark>Plato divides the souls of people into 3 categories, depending on which principle prevails in
                them:</mark> reason
            (philosophers), passion (guards and warriors) and lust (peasants, merchants, artisans).<br /><br />

            A harmonious society is the result of the realization and fulfillment by each of the citizens of his natural
            and legislative destiny.<br /><br />

            <strong>The form of an ideal state, according to Plato, can be both a monarchy and an aristocracy and
                democracy, but
                he gave preference to the monarchy.</strong> In real life, these forms of state often degenerate into
            tyranny,
            oligarchy or demagogy. And this happens when the rulers express not the national, but personal interest. To
            prevent this from happening, Plato requires the proper organization of the education of citizens.
            Philosophers must go a long way in learning wisdom before becoming rulers; in order to form the courage and
            will of the soldiers, to avoid conflicts on the basis of envy and jealousy, it is necessary for this layer
            to introduce the community of property, wives and children.<br /><br />

            Peasants, artisans, merchants need to cultivate a sense of moderation and self-restraint.<br /><br />

            <strong>The philosophy of Plato had a huge impact </strong>on the entire subsequent development of
            philosophical knowledge
            and found its continuation in the philosophical views of his student Aristotle.

        <hr />

        <h1 class="padded-multiline" id="Diogen">
            <span class="alfa">Diogenes of Sinop is an ancient Greek cynic philosopher, a student of Antisthenes. He was
                a very outstanding personality, during his lifetime he became the hero of numerous tales and
                anecdotes.</span>
        </h1>

        <p>
            Diogenes of Sinop had an extraordinary mind and practiced extreme asceticism, sometimes bordering on
            eccentric foolishness. He preached a healthy lifestyle. <strong>The simpler and poorer a person lived, refusing many
            of the benefits of civilization, the higher and more spiritual he looked in the eyes of Diogenes.</strong> He called
            himself a citizen of the world and, according to ancient legend, he lived in an ordinary clay barrel at the
            temple of the Mother of the Gods, deliberately depriving himself of numerous benefits.<br /><br />

            <strong>Diogenes, by nature, was a kind of cynic</strong> (it is easy to guess that the <em>“cynic”</em> is the <em>“cynic”</em> distorted by
            the Romans), sparing neither himself nor anyone else. He said that people are inherently evil and insidious
            - and at any opportunity, they strive to push a nearby person into a ditch, and the further, the better. But
            none of them even makes attempts to become kinder and better. He was surprised that people look into the
            distance, not noticing the simple and everyday things that happen very close. He was annoyed that they
            prayed to God for good health, while at the same time engaging in gluttony at numerous feasts.<br /><br />

            The philosopher taught that people, if possible, take care of themselves, eat simple food and drink clean
            water, cut their hair short, do not wear jewelry and frilly clothes, go barefoot as often as possible and be
            silent more, looking down. He considered people with eloquence to be idle talkers with a limited outlook.<br /><br />

            Being a deep believer, Diogenes believed that everything that happens on earth is in the power of the gods.
            He considered the wise men to be chosen people close to the gods, their close friends, and since friends
            have everything in common, absolutely everything in the world belongs to the sages. He was sure that fate
            can be outwitted if timely shows from wow and courage. He opposed nature to law, and reason to human
            passions.<br /><br />

            <strong>To those who were afraid of bad dreams, Diogenes said that it would be better if they were worried about
            what they do during the day, and not about stupid thoughts that come to mind at night.</strong> But no matter how
            cynically he treated people in general and himself in particular, the Athenians loved and revered Diogenes.
            And when one day a poor boy accidentally broke his house - a barrel, this boy was subjected to severe
            punishment, and Diogenes was given a new barrel.<br /><br />

           <strong> He considered greed to be the cause of all troubles</strong> - and he called old age, which catches a person in
            poverty, the saddest thing in life. Such a wonderful feeling as love, Diogenes called the work of idlers,
            and noble and good-natured people - likenesses of the gods. He considered human life evil, but not all life,
            but only bad.<br /><br />

            He ridiculed fame, wealth and noble birth, calling it all the embellishments of vice. And the whole world
            considered the only true state. Diogenes said that wives should be common and, therefore, sons are also
            common. He denied legal marriage. <strong>He argued that everything exists in everything and through everything,
            that is, bread contains meat, vegetables contain bread; and in general, all bodies penetrate each other with
            the smallest particles through invisible pores.</strong><br /><br />

            Once the famous commander Alexander the Great passed through Athens and stopped to look at the local
            landmark - the philosopher Diogenes. Alexander approached the barrel in which the thinker lived and offered
            to do something for him. Diogenes replied, <em><mark>"Don't block the sun for me!".</mark></em>
