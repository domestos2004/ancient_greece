            <span id="maintext">The art of Ancient Greece,</span> which played an important role in the development of
            the culture and art of
            mankind, was determined by the social and historical development of Greece, which was profoundly
            different from the development of the countries and peoples of the Ancient East. In Greece, despite the
            presence of slavery, the free labor of artisans played a huge role, until the development of slavery had
            its destructive effect on it. In Greece, within the framework of a slave-owning society, the first
            principles of democracy in history were formed, which made it possible to develop bold and profound
            ideas that affirmed the beauty and significance of man. The Greek tribes that inhabited the southernmost
            part of the Balkan Peninsula, the numerous islands of the Aegean Sea and the narrow coastal border of
            the Asia Minor coast, having passed from the primitive communal system to a class society, created an
            unprecedented richness and diversity of culture, fine arts and architecture.

                <span class="location">700-480 B.C. </span>
                <p>
                    The Archaic period is the first period in the history of ancient Greek art, which began in 700 BC.
                    and ended in 480 BC. The term "archaic" is a Greek term which means "early". It is used to describe
                    many developments in art that took place during the early stages of Greek culture. Thus, sculptural
                    works during this period indicate the initial skills that Greek sculptors displayed. This stage is a
                    stationary stage on which plays were created with no movement or flexibility. Their statues were
                    characterized by symmetry and rigidity of form. Important features of the human figure were
                    emphasized. The male figures were nude, the sculpted figures known as the Kouros figures were nude
                    because the athletes performed naked during the Olympic Games. Their left foot was in front. On the
                    other hand, the female sculpted figures called "Kore" (maiden) were fully clothed. Poses for their
                    sculpted figures included standing, kneeling, and sitting postures. The Greeks mainly sculpted the
                    figures of gods and goddesses in the likeness of men, women and children. Contemporary sculptors
                    rarely use the Kouros and Kore sculpture types.

                    Due to the lack of skill development, their sculpted figures were not realistically depicted. In
                    their desire to see smiles, the Greeks gave their lips a curved expression, which art critics call
                    the "archaic smile." It was an artificially expressed form of a smile on the face of the sculptures
                    as a result of the lack of skill in modeling. The first era of historical Greek sculpture was
                    influenced by the statue of ancient Egypt. Traditional Greek sculpture of the time was considered
                    unnatural and inflexible. The body of the sculpture of this time is criticized for the fact that
                    they are assembled as if from pieces.

                <p>
                    This is the second period in the history of Greek art. During this period, Greek art reached its
                    greatest peak. Sculpture was marked by flexibility and a comprehensive study of the representation
                    of movement. Critical observation and study of human anatomy led to the creation of sculptural
                    figures in complete realism and in their correct proportions. The Classic period are some of the
                    most widely known ancient sculptures. Stone and bronze became popular material choices during this
                    time. These statues were given "many active poses" by the ancient Greeks. Ancient Greek sculpture of
                    the classical period may have focused on movement, but the faces of these statues were largely
                    stoic. It was believed that only barbarians showed their emotions in public. Humanity was shown
                    idealistically in ancient Greek artistic sculptures.

                <span class="location">323-1 B.C. </span>
                <p>
                    This is the third and final period in the history of ancient Greek art, which began in 323 BC. and
                    ended in the 1st century. AD The term "Hellenistic" refers to the arts developed under the influence
                    of Greece over the countries of the Mediterranean during the reign of Alexander the Great. Within
                    the cultural centers of the Hellenistic world, a number of academies emerged that dealt seriously
                    with a wide range of fields, including art, literature, and medicine. Canons were designed to judge
                    quality in sculpture. This led to an increased interest in systems of proportion in sculpture. The
                    works were characterized by realism, extreme emotions, extravagant gestures, musculature and forms.
                    Movement dynamics are precise, the wind through the wing feathers and the folds of the outfit can be
                    seen in indescribable detail. The sculptors explored three-dimensional movements. One of the
                    earliest developments in sculpture during this period was the great interest in the portrait.
                    Individual resemblance was absent in both archaic and classical sculpture, but was dominant in
                    Hellenistic sculpture. Not everyone sees the differences between the ancient Greek sculpture of the
                    classical period and the traditional Greek art sculptures of the Hellenistic period.
